The Contextual Knowledge Search Platform is a chatbot interface designed to make information retrieval easy and efficient. 

It employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model that leverages Cohere LLM for language understanding and Chroma DB for storing vector embeddings.

The Contextual Knowledge Search Platform, being an on-premise solution, ensures enhanced security and data privacy by keeping company data within the organization's own secure environment.
